# General-Disease-Prediction-System-GDPS-
The health care industries collect huge amounts of data that contain some hidden information, which is useful for making effective decisions. 
For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on Data, some advanced data mining techniques are used. 

In this study, a General Disease Prediction System (GDPS) is developed using various algorithms for predicting if the patient has a Disease or not. 
The System gives option to select the disease that they want to examine for (Heart, Diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease). 

The system uses multiple medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other relevant parameters to predict the disease. 
The GDPS predicts the likelihood of patients getting the disease they choose to enter the data for. It enables significant knowledge.
E.g. Relationships between medical factors related to the disease and patterns, to be established. 

We have employed Suport Vector Machine(SVM) and Logistic Regreesion as the Training algorithms. 
The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of the specific diseases.

The Application uses following technology:
  i) Python ii) Flask iii) HTML iv) CSS

Libraries Used : 
  i) Pandas ii) Numpy iii) Scilearn  iv)Pickel
